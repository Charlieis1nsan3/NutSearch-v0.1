_#**Nut Search**#_


What is NutSearch?:
``` Nut Search is a **Web-Proxy** that can be hosted via github codespaces!```
Cool but how do I use this?
1. Simply fork this
2. open codespace with this
3. and then run chmod +x setup_and_run.sh && ./setup_and_run.sh
Then it should be hosted in a port, just simply open it.
**Enjoy!**


**Warning this is a _WIP_**
**Their is LOTS of bugs, this does not use ultraviolet. because my brain is not that big.**
But who knows, this is only the first version I might end up making a popular proxy?
