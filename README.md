#**Nut Search**#


What is NutSearch?:
``` Nut Search is a **Web-Proxy** that can be hosted via github codespaces!```
Cool but how do I use this?
1. Simply fork this
2. open codespace with this
3. and then run chmod +x setup_and_run.sh && ./setup_and_run.sh
Then it should be hosted in a port, just simply open it.
**Enjoy!**
